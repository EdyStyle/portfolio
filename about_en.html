                  <h3>Know me a little bit better</h3>
                  <p>I am a lifelong learner, self-taught individual, and I am fascinated by 
                    personal development and contributing to the growth of others. 
                    I enjoy living life and creating unique moments.<br>

                    I cultivate the philosophy that we can change the world by making 
                    a difference in one person's life at a time!<br>
                    That's why I have been working with people since my adolescence, 
                    inspiring, motivating, and teaching. I have traveled across Brazil 
                    and the world, getting to know different cultures 
                    (which is one of the main reasons I enjoy learning and speaking other languages), 
                    exploring arts, techniques, and embracing life. Above all, I strive to 
                    be my best self and contribute wholeheartedly!
                  </p>
                  <h3>Here's a glimpse into my professional journey </h3>
                  <p>As a free spirit, I have worked in various fields, primarily as a freelancer. 
                    I have been a teacher, administrator, salesperson, retail operator, call center 
                    representative, and DJ. Throughout my journey, I have participated in numerous 
                    competitions where I experienced wins, losses, and valuable lessons.
                    I have been involved in several projects focused on commercial growth, business 
                    expansion, and the development and leadership of high-performing individuals and 
                    teams. These experiences have taken me across markets in Europe, Latin America, 
                    and Brazil.
                    Embracing a diverse range of roles and markets has allowed me to gain a broad 
                    perspective and adaptability. It has shaped my ability to connect with people 
                    from different backgrounds, understand their needs, and find innovative solutions.
                    I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my horizons. 
                    I believe in the power of continuous learning and personal growth, and I am 
                    committed to making a positive impact wherever I go.
                    Please explore my portfolio to delve deeper into the specific projects, 
                    achievements, and skills that have shaped my professional journey. 
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about my experiences!"
                  <h3>Regarding priority</h3>
                  <p>I have a passion for promoting an inspiring culture driven by a people-first 
                    mindset, with the ultimate goal of providing a world-class experience for employees
                    and customers. I am dedicated to investing in personal growth, as well as the growth 
                    of others, always operating with integrity and making the most of the journey!
